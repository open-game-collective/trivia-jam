# Trivia Jam ðŸŽ®

Trivia Jam is a real-time multiplayer trivia game designed for social gatherings, classrooms, and events. Players join from their phones while questions and scores are displayed on a shared TV or large screen.

## How It Works ðŸŽ¯

1. **Host Creates Game**: A host starts a game and gets a unique game code
2. **Players Join**: Players join using the game code on their phones at triviajam.tv
3. **Questions**: The host presents numerical questions (e.g., "What year was the Declaration of Independence signed?")
4. **Fast-Paced Answers**: Players submit their answers within a time limit
5. **Scoring**: Points are awarded based on accuracy and speed:
   - Exact answers get more points
   - When no exact answers exist, the closest answer scores
   - Faster correct answers rank higher
   - Ties are handled fairly with averaged points

## Features âœ¨
