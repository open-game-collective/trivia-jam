# Trivia Jam V2: Numerical Speed Trivia

## Core Changes Overview

The V2 update transforms Trivia Jam into a speed-based numerical trivia game with sophisticated scoring mechanics. This document outlines the key changes and new scoring system.

## New Game Mechanics

### 1. Timed Answer Submission
- Players have a configurable time window (default: 30 seconds) to submit their answer
- All players can submit during this window
- Timer starts immediately when host submits the question
- No "buzzing in" required - all players can answer simultaneously

### 2. Numerical Answers Only
- All questions must have numerical answers
- Examples:
  - "How many states are in the US?" (Answer: 50)
  - "What year was Elvis Presley born?" (Answer: 1935)
  - "How many bones are in the human body?" (Answer: 206)

### 3. Dynamic Scoring System

#### Basic Rules
- Only top 30% of players (rounded down) can score points per question
- Points are awarded based on:
  1. Answer accuracy
  2. Submission speed
- Minimum 3 scoring positions in any game

#### Scoring Tiers
For a 10-player game (30% = 3 scoring positions):
```
1st place: 3 points
2nd place: 2 points
3rd place: 1 point
```

For a 20-player game (30% = 6 scoring positions):
```
1st place: 6 points
2nd place: 5 points
3rd place: 4 points
4th place: 3 points
5th place: 2 points
6th place: 1 point
```

### Scoring Scenarios

#### Exact Match Scenario
Question: "How many states are in the US?"
Correct Answer: 50

```
Player   Answer   Time      Points
Alice    50       5.2s      3
Bob      50       5.8s      2
Carol    50       6.1s      1
Dave     50       6.3s      0
Eve      50       7.0s      0
```

#### Closest Match Scenario
Question: "What year was Elvis Presley born?"
Correct Answer: 1935

```
Player   Answer   Time      Diff    Points
Alice    1936     4.2s      1       3
Bob      1934     4.8s      1       2
Carol    1937     3.1s      2       1
Dave     1933     5.3s      2       0
Eve      1940     3.0s      5       0
```

### Tie-Breaking Rules

1. **Exact Matches**
   - First tiebreaker: Submission time
   - Players with exact matches always rank above close matches

2. **Close Matches**
   - First tiebreaker: Absolute difference from correct answer
   - Second tiebreaker: Submission time
   - Equal differences split points (average of positions)

Example of point splitting:
```
Question: "What year was the Declaration of Independence signed?"
Answer: 1776

Player   Answer   Time    Diff    Position    Points
Alice    1775     2.1s    1       1-2         2.5
Bob      1777     1.8s    1       1-2         2.5
Carol    1774     3.1s    2       3           1
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### State Machine Updates
- Add configuration for answer time window
- Track answer submissions with timestamps
- Implement scoring calculation logic
- Store previous question results

### New Context Properties
```typescript
type GameSettings = {
  answerTimeWindow: number;  // in seconds
  questionCount: number;
  maxPlayers: number;
}

type Answer = {
  playerId: string;
  value: number;
  timestamp: number;
}

type QuestionResult = {
  correctAnswer: number;
  answers: Answer[];
  scores: Array<{
    playerId: string;
    points: number;
    position: number;
  }>;
}

type GamePublicContext = {
  // ... existing properties ...
  settings: GameSettings;
  currentQuestion: {
    text: string;
    startTime: number;
    answers: Answer[];
  } | null;
  questionResults: QuestionResult[];
}
```

### New Events
```typescript
type GameClientEvent =
  | { type: "SUBMIT_ANSWER"; value: number }
  | { type: "SUBMIT_QUESTION"; text: string; answer: number }
  | // ... existing events ...

type GameServiceEvent =
  | { type: "ANSWER_TIMEOUT" }
  | { type: "UPDATE_SCORES"; results: QuestionResult }
  | // ... existing events ...
```

## UI/UX Considerations

### Host View
- Input field for correct numerical answer
- Display of all submitted answers in real-time
- Timer countdown display
- Results visualization after question closes

### Player View
- Numerical input field
- Timer countdown
- Immediate feedback on submission
- Position/points earned display after scoring

### Game Board View
- Timer countdown
- Real-time answer submission indicators
- Scoring animation/display
- Historical question results
